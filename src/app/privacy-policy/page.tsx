                  This Data Protection Policy sets out the minimum standards
                  that must be met by the Company. It is important that you and
                  your customers understand the purpose of the data retention
                  legislation to enable us to comply with the legislation. This
                  Policy sets out your responsibilities in relation to data
                  retention legislation and applies to all employees, customers,
                  and, where appropriate, third parties working for, or on

                  The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility to

                  However, all employees, including University Counsellors,
                  Admissions Officers, Placement Workers, and Administrative
                  Managers, all undertake responsibility for compliance under
                  their employment. We use personal data to provide professional
                  consultancy and management services to our clients. It is

                  Personal data must be processed in a manner that respects
                  legality, justice, and transparency in relation to the data
                  subject. The GDPR only allows Processing for specific
                  purposes, known as legal grounds or processing conditions. One
                  of these grounds must be met for Processing to be considered

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Consent must be a clear manifestation of agreement, which may
                  be expressed by a statement or by an affirmative action by the
                  Data Subject with respect to the Processing. Consent must be
                  given actively. If Consent is contained in a document that
                  addresses multiple issues, this must be treated separately.
                  Data Subjects must be able to easily revoke their Consent to
                  Processing at any time. Any request for revocation must be
                  complied with immediately. Consent may need to be updated
                  periodically. Vela Chinesa must document all forms of Consent
                  on which it relies and keep a record of all of them, thus
                  ensuring that we have the appropriate authorization for the

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The GDPR requires Data Controllers to provide detailed and
                  specific information to Data Subjects, depending on whether
                  the information was collected directly from Data Subjects or
                  elsewhere. This information must be provided by means of
                  appropriate Privacy Notices or Fair Processing Notices, which
                  must be concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible,
                  and in plain and simple language so that a Data Subject can
                  easily understand it. Whenever we collect Personal Data
                  directly from Data Subjects, including for human resources or
                  customer service purposes, we must provide the Data Subject
                  with all the information required by the GDPR. Where the
                  Personal Data is collected indirectly (for example, from a
                  publicly available source or medium), we must provide the Data
                  Subject with all the information required by the GDPR as soon
                  as possible after collecting/receiving the Personal Data. We
                  must also verify whether the Personal Data was collected by a
                  GDPR-compliant party and on a basis that considers our
                  intended Processing of such Personal Data, i.e., that the
                  party knew that your Personal Data would be passed on to us
                  and for what purpose. This means that all third parties we
                  work with who process personal data collected by Vela Chinesa
                  must also comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.

                  Personal Data must be collected for specified, explicit, and

                  than those disclosed to the Data Subject at the time it was
